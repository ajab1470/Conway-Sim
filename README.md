# Conway-Sim
Simple simulation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript

Conway's Game of life is an automated simulation of cells that live, breed, and die.

Currently, this implementations is a simple ASCII representation of 
Life. Eventually, however, it will be visually represented in html elements. The next step after that is to allow users to define their own start board to create whatever patterns they choose

Note: to run in your own html, simply include a div with id "board" wherever you want the simulation to display
