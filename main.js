 * conway board: 2d array of booleans. Each value represents a 'cell' with true representing a live cell and false
 *   representing a nonliving cell
 * neighbor: one of the 8 adjacent cells on a board. Diagonals included and wraps around to the other side of the board
 *   in the case of cells on the edge of the board
 * tick: the moment at which cells can change from living to nonliving or vice versa. Note: All changes of a tick happen
 *   simultaneously (changes from the same tick do not affect each other)
